# This repository was created to maintain work with projecting and building electronic device.

This simple device  should be able to do few simple tasks listed below:

* generate random numbers which is done with unstable LSB of ADC result :game_die:, 

* measure hold and release button time pressed by user :watch:,

* control vibrating motor with desired timer intervals,

* motor control on diffrent power sources with use of transistor and PWM, 

* smoothly working finite state machine with energy power saving state :battery:.

## Additional informations:

* in this project I used ATmega32 MCU,
* small (10 mm x 2 mm) vibrating motor.


### SUMMARY
* I won't continue develop on this repository.
